Sentiment Trading
How it works
Real-time composite sentiment score per asset (0–100) combining:
Social sentiment (X/Twitter), Reddit
News tone/volume
Market regime signals (volatility, funding, spread/volume shifts)
Explainability: each signal shows “why” (e.g., “news buzz ↑, social polarity ↑, vol ↑”)
Data sources
Start: LunarCrush (free tier), selected news RSS, X/Twitter keyword tracking
Later: on-chain metrics (Glassnode/alternatives), additional news APIs
Use of sentiment
MVP: provide signals + “one-tap trade” (user confirms)
Phase 2: optional auto-trade when confidence + risk checks pass (daily loss cap, circuit breaker)
Platform Scope
App type: Web application (responsive, mobile-first). iOS wrapper (Capacitor) after MVP.
Trading mode: Paper/sandbox and live trading (live limited to small size by default).
Exchanges (priority)
Coinbase – OAuth one-click connect (MVP)
Kraken – guided API key wizard (MVP)
Binance (partner/OAuth) → phase 2
KuCoin / Bybit (manual API) → phase 2
Target Users
Primary: Retail beginners to intermediate traders who want safe, simple, sentiment-led automation.
Secondary: Small SMEs or treasury-minded users managing €50k+ crypto who value risk controls.
Positioning: “Safety-first AI trading assistant” — fastest setup + clear, explainable signals.
