How to host these at /privacy and /terms on Replit
If you’re using Node/Express:
// server.js (excerpt)
import express from "express";
import path from "path";
import { fileURLToPath } from "url";

const app = express();
const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
const __dirname = path.dirname(__filename);

// Serve static policy pages
app.use("/static", express.static(path.join(__dirname, "static")));

app.get("/privacy", (_req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, "static", "privacy.html"));
});
app.get("/terms", (_req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, "static", "terms.html"));
});

app.listen(process.env.PORT || 5000, () => {
  console.log("Server running");
});
Place the two HTML files as:
/static/privacy.html
/static/terms.html
