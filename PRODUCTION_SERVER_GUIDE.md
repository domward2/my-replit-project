# Production Server Deployment Guide

## ‚úÖ Local Production Server Verification

The production server is working perfectly locally with all SEO fixes:

### Verified Working Features:
- **Clean Title**: "PnL AI ‚Äî AI-powered crypto trading made simple" (no version info)
- **SEO Content**: Hidden structured content with h1, h2, main tags accessible to crawlers
- **Health Endpoint**: `/health` returns `{"status":"ok","version":"2.1.0","timestamp":"..."}`
- **Security Headers**: Helmet configured with CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.
- **NoScript Fallback**: Proper messaging for JavaScript-disabled users

### Commands That Work Locally:
```bash
# Build and start production server
npm run build
npm run start  # or: node dist/index.js

# Test endpoints
curl -s http://localhost:5000/health
curl -s http://localhost:5000/ | grep '<title>'
curl -s http://localhost:5000/ | grep -A 5 'data-seo-content'
```

## üîß For Deployment

The issue is that Replit deployment is configured to run development mode (`npm run dev`) instead of production mode.

### Deployment Configuration:
- **Build Command**: `npm run build` (already correct in .replit)
- **Run Command**: Should be `npm run start` (currently `npm run dev`)

### To Fix Deployment:
1. **Manual Deploy**: Use the deploy button - it should use the correct production commands from .replit deployment section
2. **Verify After Deploy**: Check that the deployed version serves the production build

### Expected Results After Proper Deployment:
- Clean page title without version numbers
- SEO content visible to crawlers but hidden from users
- /health endpoint returning JSON status
- Security headers properly configured
- NoScript fallback working

## üìä Current Status

- ‚úÖ **Production Build**: Working perfectly
- ‚úÖ **Production Server**: All features verified locally
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Deployment**: Still serving development version
- üéØ **Solution**: Deploy using production commands

The application is ready for production deployment!
