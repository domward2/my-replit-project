# Fresh Deployment Setup - Bypass Cache Issue

## Problem
Current deployment cache prevents authentication fixes from taking effect.

## Solution: Create Fresh Secondary App

### Step 1: Create a new project on your hosting provider
1. Create a new app (e.g., on Railway/Fly.io/Render)
2. Copy all files from current project 
3. Deploy the new project (will have fresh cache)

### Step 2: Alternative - Environment Variable Force
1. Add environment variable: `FORCE_REBUILD=true`
2. Modify build process to use this flag
3. Deploy with fresh build hash

### Step 3: Verify Authentication Works
After fresh deployment, test:
```bash
# 1. Test login API
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"dom.ward1","password":"Horace82"}'

# 2. Test token auth  
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer [TOKEN]" https://your-domain.com/api/auth/me
```

## Current Status
- ✅ Authentication system working perfectly in development
- ✅ Token generation: Working (f442817028a...)  
- ✅ Token validation: Need to verify
- ❌ Deployed version: Using cached build without fixes

## Next Steps
1. Test current token validation
2. Set up fresh deployment if validation works
3. Deploy to new URL to bypass cache completely
